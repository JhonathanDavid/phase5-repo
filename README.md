### Project Overview

This project will look into a Real Estate database to find valuable information about the value of homes and return on investment. My company, Xabios data international, has been hired to determind the change of prices in this market over time and to determine which areas have the most potential to increase. Thus, this project is aimed at two very targeted goal using Time Series Modeling :
Jupyter Notebook A brief note on this Jupyter notebook. This notebook presents story line following this structure:
* Part 1: Overview, Business Understanding & Objective 
* Part 2 : EDA
* Part 3 : Modeling
* Part 4 : Conclusion

### Business Modeling Objectives

1. Understand Real Estate Prices - how they have changed overtime 
2. Find out Real Estate Areas of Growth Measured by ROI


### Business Understanding & Business Problem
As important to Telecommunications companies as it is to earn new customers to their services, is the need to retain current customers and preventing them from going to competitors. The act of leaving customers or loss of customers are referred to in this industry as "Churn", from a business perspective. The business would like to understand exactly what factors or situations contribute to churning, and most importantly, post identification of those factors, define precises strategic initiatives to retain customers. This project, therefore aims to help the business first in identifying the attributes and factors that cause the churn, and in turn, building models that can help the business predict it, so that in fact strategic business initiatives can be outlined for solution.


### Important Modeling Sucess Considerations

We are conducting a Time Series Analysis over the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI):A data set that tracks a sample of real estate prices over time. In particular, a time series allows one to see what factors influence certain variables from period to period. Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, in this case Real Estate, or economic variable, in this case ROI, changes over time.

### Conclusions
Modeling derived results to invest in these ZIP Codes due to Higher ROI
Highest projected ROI:
* 6069 = 24.12%
* 6610 = 31%
* 6330 = 21%
* 6039 = 19%
* 6058 = 19%.
